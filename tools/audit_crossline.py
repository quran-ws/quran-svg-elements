"""Ink held by a word on one line but drawn in another line's territory.

The interval audit compares words along a line and the mark audit compares
counts against the text; neither can see a word holding ink that belongs to
the line above or below it. A reviewer can — "this ه is stolen from the word
below", "it has a ه at the top stolen from the word above but it is not
flagged" — so this looks for exactly that.

A mark legitimately rides above its own letters and may cross a band edge, so
the test is not "which band is it in". It is: does this ink sit closer to a
word on the OTHER line than to the word holding it, and does that other word's
own ink stand directly over or under it?
