"""RTL interval audit.

Scan each line right-to-left. Each word's BODY ink gives an interval; the part
of it no other word touches is that word's *exclusive core*. A mark sitting in
another word's exclusive core is misplaced ink -- and unlike a mark count, this
stays true when two words swap marks, so it sees chain shifts and cycles.

A flag has two possible causes, and they need opposite fixes:
  BODY-STEAL  the holder lost a letter piece, so its interval is too short and
              its own marks fall inside the thief. Re-partition; do NOT move
              the mark -- that would strip the word of a vowel it really owns.
  MARK-STEAL  both words have healthy ink and the mark alone is in the wrong
              word. Safe to move.
Separating them needs the width prior and the joining-rule piece count.
