"""Build the defect queue every lane works from.

One row per open defect, routed to the lane whose evidence can actually settle
it, and ranked by how many defects one decision would close. Reads the latest
full sweep (audit_marks + audit_intervals per page) and writes
docs/defects/queue.json plus a short summary.

Lanes
  auto    a mechanical invariant decides it: side rules, text budgets, the
          joining-rule piece count, reading order, band membership.
  label   a shape is named wrong. One human decision per SHAPE fixes every
          occurrence mushaf-wide, through .cache/marks/labels.json.
  place   this ink, on this page, belongs to that word. Nothing general to
          learn; one human decision per occurrence, via overrides.json.
  judge   the audit and the artwork disagree and neither is obviously right.
